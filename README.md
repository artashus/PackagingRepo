This repository contains sources for building the vsftpd.rpm package. Please, follow the instructions below to get started.
 
## Install required packages

Run the commands below to install packages required for building rpm packages

```bash
$ yum -y update
$ yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools
```

## Create build directory structure

To setup the build environment on Centos7 go to users home directory and run the command below

```bash
$ rpmdev-setuptree
```

Make sure the directory was created succesfully

```bash
$ ls -l rpmbuild

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Oct 25 03:09 BUILD
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Oct 25 03:09 RPMS
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Oct 25 03:09 SOURCES
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Oct 25 03:09 SPECS
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Oct 25 03:09 SRPMS
```

If the directory structure failed to create by the command above, you can manually create it

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS,tmp}
```

## Install git

Skip this step if you already have git set up on your Centos7 build environment

```bash
$ yum install git
```

## Clone current git repo

```

Copy the .spec file to the ~/rpmbuild/SPECS directory

```bash
$ cp vsftpd.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
```
